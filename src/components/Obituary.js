          Beyond the lecture hall, John was a devoted husband to Mary for 45 years, a loving father to John Jr. 
          and Niamh, and a doting grandfather to his five grandchildren. His family was the center of his universe, 
          and he took immense pride in their accomplishments and shared moments together.

          summer barbecues in his Tramore home became a cherished tradition, bringing together family, friends, and 
          colleagues for afternoons filled with laughter, music, and his famous homemade brown bread.
